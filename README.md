# Digital_Clock_using_java
Make a simple GUI Digital Clock using showing current time and date using java
Create a new JAVA file you can name it anything.so first  make the GUI, for this go to swing  after that making main method in this menu  create a JFrame object frame & name time then set the position of the frame & set bounds function , set it in a position of 600,100  width of 500 and a height  200.  . we have to set it to true after that add a panel on this frame so that panel will contain all these different clock the times, a panel so jpanel p new j panel.  the ct is equal to j label current time so let's make this as a class attribute. private j label ct and also i need another label for that date part so for date partit as date only. now with this ct we want to first set the position so ct dot set pounds let's set it to 10, 40, 10 and 480, 60 . the date part is also below at some position like here i have set the string to null so you can't see it so now let's move n to the main part that is the the date and time part  so for doing this date and time part use a  thread, thread will keep on updating the value  so for the thread, use the thread class and then create constructor over here so my clock so this my clock constructor will uh will be called when the thread is created so we have to override the run method  in the run method all those thread stuffs and we'll update the things and before doing that we have to call this so after setting the frame visible we have to create a new instance of this class. so new class will be called from here and for this part we will call the start and call the start metal to start this thread so this start method will call this run and we can run this so uh in the run part we'll create something like while true, so we'll run this thread infinitely.create a calender object, the time calculations so for time calculation we we need some uh variables so we  need a calendar variable we need this calendar variable so after that we need our minutes we need seconds and we need one more variable which will give us the amount am & pm so for thatwe would  use the reduce the uh integer variable so private and r minute second and am pm  so these are the things used for the time calculation and also for date we'll need some more variables  so the first will be day of week, we need the day of week and then we will need the year then we need the month then we will need the date the particular day of the month. for creating calendar of the with, the with  current system date and time need to call this static method from the calendar class that is get instance so by calling the guess you get instance we can create a get a calendar class object so this after that we would like to get for getting to call this calendar dot get and in this field we have to pass the particular constant that is the r constant so it will be calendar dot r so by this we'll get the r of the day then for minutes similarly we have to do the same thing calendar dot get calendar okay calendar dot minute and for second also uh equals to can and uh it will be cal not calendar.  we'll get all the time uh things down minutes second and now we need the dates so for date first we are going to do this day of week then year then month then day so  to get the day of week we first need this day is cal dot get like the similar way we do did that time part then we need the day of month so day of month so this is a number ranging between 1 to 31  any one between this range will get this day and for next thing we need the day of week so day of week is what is like the monday tuesday or that so get the calendar dot day of week this one so this uh as it shows that uh it shows that we are going to get the day of week in this order sunday monday tuesday wednesday and this is not going to return this thing it will it is going to return integer from value from one to seven so sunday is on sunday is uh sunday is considered one and saturday is considered seven like this we'll getso after this we are going to create the month, month is get like same dot month and here is also same so after doing this so this part is uh dates after doing this we are going to do we are going to request something so first of all as i have said that this day of weekwe had to convert it into a stream so for doing this we need and also fo month so month also returns uh returns a value between between uh 1 to 12 so i have to convert this to string so let's create a let's create this arrays so first will be the a string array of string array of months so we'll be uh taking values from this array and using it in our uh for showing it to the user so it will be li so this is the same thing the area i'm copy pasting this from my previous program so this part so we have to just write this in this order january february march april and it will end with december so this area is very useful for determining the month from that month number and also i need the same for that days so for days i'm going to use this array so this will return me the days by the day number so now we have since we have created those array we need to get the day and also the so before doing that we can first uh select the date and time and and the am pm so first converting the mpm to string we need to do this uh we have to give a condition that if m pm is equal to 1 or it's 0 so in case uh if it's zero so it's always aim so let's uh make another let's make another string type object and let's name it as s so this s will contain the a mod pm string so if a pm equals equals to 0 s will be a so always remember that 0 is for m and 1 is for pm so so else else uh s equals to am so that's all for this  am pm part and then we have to set the text so as have  already mentioned this ct so this ct dot set text we have to change this text every time, while loop is running so ct dot set text since we have got all our date time variables now we can set this text so first we need this current time will be there then we have the show  then  colon then we will show the minute then again a colon and like this format we can show uh like second and after that we'll show finally this a mod pm so show am yes so and then we have to set the frame visible or update the frame so frame dot set visible fr set visible let's make this frame also a static the class variable so private static frame j frame frame calling that function so it will be day of week and since the indexing starts from one we have to reduct one to get the actual date so this will be the first thing that will be said then uh separated by a comma then then will be the day this is the day of the month and then it will be separated by a space and then months months of that index that we got that is month so after doing this we have to the final thing that is remaining is the year so were so here is also set now let's run this again and see if this works or not okay so as you can see this is today's monday 5th april 2021 and the time is also showing perfect so now let's change uh the font and this so so font so font we have to import so import java ewt font let's import everything and so for for the font we have to create this font for uh ct and also for date so the ct and also for date here let's create font so ct dot set font set font uh i would like to create this helvetic you can give any font name as you wish so there are lots of fonts in awt so the style will be font dot bold and the size i would like to keep it let's say 35 so it will be bigger okay and that's all for this city and in date um it set font new font also helvetica font bold and and the size for this will be uh lesser than that one so let's keep it 31 so it will be a smaller size than the current date so for uh the next thing we need to do is to create uh to give a color so if we want to give a color so we can do it like date set foreground so color dot like gray or dark darkly and for this city i would like to give the color as ct set background foreground color dot black so that is good and i hope this looks good now so let's run this also yeah so it's looking better now and yes so uh it's almost done so if you want you can give more like beautify these things the panel and everything so this was uh very basic this application uh on the digital clock so the main thing uh over here was this uh this part this run part and one thing i want to optimize this part so for that see if i run this java file it's showing this current time but actually this while loop is running too much and we don't need to run this too much because uh the actual update is getting only after one second so why waste so much uh cpu power using the running this while loop too much in a second so we can just run it in like twice or thrice in just in a second so for doing that i would like to uh sleep make this uh thread sleep for some time maybe like 200 milliseconds i can sleep it like 200 or 200 will be a good uh time so it will be if we create a thread okay does sleep so we have to handle the exception so try not try block we have to catch this exception and let's format this document so that's all about this program. 

thank you
